- Generative AI subset of deep learning
- LLM subset of deep learning

Deep Learning Model Type:
    - Generative
        - generates new data similar to trained data
        - understands distribution of data
        - predict next word in sequence

    - Discriminative
        - classify or predict
        - trained on labled data
        - learns relationship between features of data points and labels



    Not Gen AI, output is 
        - number
        - discrete
        - class
        - probability

    Is Gen AI, output is 
        - Natural Language

Generative Language Models learn about patterns in language thru training data 
    - pattern mathing system 


Gen Ai derived from Transformers:
    - Transformer model consists of 
        - encoder: encodes input sequence / passes to decoder
        - decoder: learns to decode the representation for a task 

Hallucinations: words / phrases generated by model that are non-sensical / incorrect

prompt: piece of text givent to LLM as input
            - can be used to control output of model


model types:
    text-to-text
    text-to-image
    text-to-video
    text-to-3D

[week 1]
- AI is a set of tools 
    - Supervised learning (labeling things)
    - Unsupervised learning 
    - Reinforcement learning 
    - Generative AI

Supervised learning  (labeling things)
    Input   -> Output


    Input (A)           Output (B)             |   Application
    -------------------------------------------|----------------------------------
     Email                 Spam?  (0/1)        |  Spam filtering
     Ad, user info         Click? (0/1)        |  Online advertising
     Image, radar info   Position other cars   |  Self-driving car
     x-ray image           Diagnosis           |  Healthcare
     image of phone        Defect? (0/1)       |  Visual inspection
     audio recording       Text transcript     |  Speech recognition
     restaurant reviews    Sentiment (neg/pos) |  Reputation monitoring

2010 - 2020: Large scale supervised learning
    Small AI models:  larger data didn't not result in better performance
    Large AI models:  larger data DID result in better performance

    i.e. Let's build large models and feed them ALOT of data
            - pathway to Generative AI


How LLMs work: 
    - LLMs are built by using supervised learning (A -> B) to repeatedly predict the next word. 

        ex. My favorite food is a bagel with cream cheese
    Input (A)  [prompt]                       | Output (B)  [response]
    ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------
    My favorite food is a                     |  bagel
    My favorite food is a bagel               |  with 
    My favorite food is a bagel with          |  cream  
    My favorite food is a bagel with cream    |  cheese 

    When train an AI system on hundreds of billions of words, get an LLM


Uses for LLMs:
    - writing / brainstorming
    - reading / read and summerize text (emails, etc.)
    - chatting / chatbots
    web  vs.  app 

Gen AI Applications:
  Text:
    - brainstorming
    - writing emails / articles
    - translations (Priate English)

  Reading:
    - proofreading
    - summary
    - email analysis 
    - sentiment / reputation monitoring
    NOTE: refine prompts with additional information

  Chatting:
    - customer service


LLMs: Can vs. Can't Do
Can:
    - can a college grad execute the prompt ?  (guideline)
            - add data to complete the task
    - knowledge cutoffs, LLMs training stops at a certain date
    - Hallucinations: ask about well known people and you may get dubious quotes
    - input / output length is limited
    - Does not work well with structured (tabular) data (used supervised data for this)
    - Works best with unstructured data 
    - Bias / Toxicity


Tips for prompting:

    - Be detailed and specific 
            - Give enough context to complete the task
            - describe taks in detail

    - Guide the model to think through its answer
            - give steps thru the answer 
                    Brainstorm 5 names for a new baby toy.
                    Step 1: Come up with 5 fun, joyful words that relate to human babies.
                    Step 2: For each word, come up with a rhyming name for a toy.
                    Step 3: Fore each toy name, add a fun relevant emoji.
            
    - Experiment and iterate
            - develop a process to iterate 
            - improve prompts

            Idea -----> Prompt -----> LLM Response  ----->  Refine --+
             ^-------------------------------------------------------+
                        (add more detail or detailed task)

Image Generation :

   Image Generation (diffusion model) 
        - learns from images on the Internet (via supervised learning)
        - take an image and then add "noise" to the image
            - teach model to take "noisy" image and generate less-noisy image ---+
                ^------------------------- REPEAT -------------------------------+ 
                NOTE: typically 100 steps for a diffusion model

        - image has text caption associated with it 
        - to generate new image 
            - image is pure noisy 
            - input prompt from user 
            - diffuse to lessy noisy image (repeat per above)

Two Types of LLMs:

Base LLM                                            Instruction Tuned LLM 
--------------                                      ---------------------------------------

                                                    - fine-tune on instructions
                                                    - Trained with instructions and good attempts to follow instructions
                                                    - RHLF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback

NOTE: Are the instructions clear / detailed / specified enough to return viable responses


## Guidelines

Principles:
    1. Write clear and specific instructions
    2. Give model time to think

NOTE: Check jupyter notebooks in code directory 
    i.e. ~/AI_COURSES/code/L2_guidelines.ipynb



Principle 1. Write clear and specific instructions
    clear != short 

# Tactic 1: use delimeters 
    triple quotes: """
    triple backticks: """
    triple backticks: """

example code: 

text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)

# Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out of its own solution before rushing to conclusion
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```

Question:
```
I'm building a solar power installation and I need help \

- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations \
as a function of the number of square feet.
``` 
Student's solution:
```
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```
Actual solution:
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

To calculate the total cost for the first year of operations, we need to add up the costs of land, solar panels, and maintenance.

1. Land cost: $100 / square foot
The cost of land is $100 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

2. Solar panel cost: $250 / square foot
The cost of solar panels is $250 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

3. Maintenance cost: $100,000 + $10 / square foot
The maintenance cost is a flat fee of $100,000 per year, plus $10 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

Total cost: Land cost + Solar panel cost + Maintenance cost

Let's calculate the total cost using the actual solution:

Total cost = (100 * x) + (250 * x) + (100,000 + (10 * x))
           = 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x
           = 360x + 100,000

Is the student's solution the same as the actual solution just calculated:
No

Student grade:
Incorrect

"""

The AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie is a technologically advanced toothbrush designed to provide a superior 
brushing experience. Boie is a company known for its innovative oral care products, and the AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart 
Toothbrush is no exception.

One of the standout features of this toothbrush is its ultra-slim design. The brush head is only 2mm thick, making it 
much thinner than traditional toothbrushes. This slim profile allows for better access to hard-to-reach areas of the mouth,
 ensuring a thorough and effective clean.

The AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush also incorporates smart technology. It connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth, 
allowing users to track their brushing habits and receive personalized recommendations for improving their oral hygiene 
routine. The app provides real-time feedback on brushing technique, ensuring that users are brushing for the recommended two minutes and covering all areas of their mouth.

The toothbrush itself is made from a durable and hygienic material called thermoplastic elastomer. This material is 
non-porous, meaning it doesn't harbor bacteria or mold, making it more hygienic than traditional toothbrush bristles. 
The bristles are also ultra-soft, providing a gentle yet effective clean without causing any damage to the gums or enamel.


In addition to its technological features, the AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush is also eco-friendly. It is designed 
to last for up to six months, reducing the need for frequent replacements. The brush head is also replaceable, further 
reducing waste.

Overall, the AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie offers a combination of advanced technology, slim design, 
and eco-friendly features. It aims to provide users with a superior brushing experience, helping them maintain optimal 
oral health.
