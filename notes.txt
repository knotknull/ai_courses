- Generative AI subset of deep learning
- LLM subset of deep learning

Deep Learning Model Type:
    - Generative
        - generates new data similar to trained data
        - understands distribution of data
        - predict next word in sequence

    - Discriminative
        - classify or predict
        - trained on labled data
        - learns relationship between features of data points and labels



    Not Gen AI, output is 
        - number
        - discrete
        - class
        - probability

    Is Gen AI, output is 
        - Natural Language
        - Image
        - Audio

    ex. PaLM : Pathways Language Model 
        LaMDA: Language Model for Dialogue Applications


Generative AI: 
    - type of AI that create new content based on what it has learned from existing content
    - process of learning from existing content is training 
        - results in creation of statistical model
    - given a prompt, GenAI uses statistical model to predict what response might be

Generative Language Models learn about patterns in language thru training data 
    - pattern mathing system 


Gen Ai derived from Transformers:
    - Transformer model consists of 
        - encoder: encodes input sequence / passes to decoder
        - decoder: learns to decode the representation for a task 

Hallucinations: words / phrases generated by model that are non-sensical / incorrect

prompt: piece of text givent to LLM as input
            - can be used to control output of model


model types:
    text-to-text
    text-to-image
    text-to-video
    text-to-3D
    text-to-task

ex. Vertex AI: model garden that includes foundation models
    Language: PaLM API for Chat
              PaLM API for Text
              BERT
    Vision:   Stable Diffustion v1-5
              BLIP image captioning 
              CLIP 
              OWL, etc.


Model Garden Task Specific Models 

    Language: Extraction: 
                    - Syntax Analysis
              Classification: 
                    - Entity Analysis
                    - Content Classification
                    - Sentiment Analysis
                    - Entity Sentiment Analysis

    Vision:   Classification: 
                    - Object detector
              Detection:
                    - Occupancy analytics
                    - Person / Vehicle detector
                    - PPE detector
                    - Person blur


Colab: Google's free Jupyter

GenAI Studio: create and deploy GenAI Models 
            - Language / Vision
            - Library of pre-trained models
            - tool to fine tunemodels
            - AI App Builder
                    - create gen AI apps wihout writing code


- Vertext AI Search and Conversation

- MakerSuite: prototype apps using PaLM API
    - model training tool
    - model deployment tool
    - model monitoring tool
